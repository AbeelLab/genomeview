demo	B. anthracis	b_anthracis.jpg	This tutorial data set contains a bacterial genome <b>sequence</b> with <b>annotations for genes, rRNA and tRNA</b>.  Two sequencing data sets are included as well: (i) an <b>RNA-seq experiment</b> and (ii) a <b>whole genome sequencing</b> experiment. Furthermore, there are two optional <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/b_anthracis/download/anthracis.maf.gz"><b>multiple alignments</b></a> available for this genome.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/b_anthracis/session.php
demo	C. elegans	c_elegans.jpg	This tutorial data set includes the reference <b>sequence</b> for <i>C. elegans</i>, as well as its <b>gene annotion</b>. We also included an <b>RNA-seq</b> data set, both as individual reads and as a pileup track.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/c_elegans/session.php
demo	D. melanogaster	d_melanogaster.jpg	This tutorial data set includes the reference <b>sequence</b> for D. melanogaster, as well as <b>gene annotation</b>. A <b>multiple alignment</b> of twelve Drosophila species is included as a MAF file. Furthermore, transcriptome data in the form of <b>paired-end RNA-seq</b> is loaded. 	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/d_melanogaster/session.php
microbial	M. tuberculosis	mtb.jpg	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a pathogenic bacterial species in the genus Mycobacterium and the causative agent of most cases of tuberculosis.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/mtb_h37rv_v2/session.php	
animal	H. sapiens (hg19)	hsapiens.png	Humans, known taxonomically as Homo sapiens, are the only living species in the Homo genus of bipedal primates in Hominidae, the great ape family. Anatomically modern-appearing humans originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago, reaching full behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/hg19/session.php
