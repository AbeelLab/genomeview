demo	B. anthracis	b_anthracis.jpg	This tutorial data set contains a bacterial genome <b>sequence</b> with <b>annotations for genes, rRNA and tRNA</b>.  Two sequencing data sets are included as well: (i) an <b>RNA-seq experiment</b> and (ii) a <b>whole genome sequencing</b> experiment. Furthermore, there are two optional <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/b_anthracis/download/anthracis.maf.gz"><b>multiple alignments</b></a> available for this genome.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/b_anthracis/session.php
demo	C. elegans	c_elegans.jpg	This tutorial data set includes the reference <b>sequence</b> for <i>C. elegans</i>, as well as its <b>gene annotion</b>. We also included an <b>RNA-seq</b> data set, both as individual reads and as a pileup track.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/c_elegans/session.php
demo	D. melanogaster	d_melanogaster.jpg	This tutorial data set includes the reference <b>sequence</b> for D. melanogaster, as well as <b>gene annotation</b>. A <b>multiple alignment</b> of twelve Drosophila species is included as a MAF file. Furthermore, transcriptome data in the form of <b>paired-end RNA-seq</b> is loaded. 	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/d_melanogaster/session.php
microbial	M. tuberculosis	mtb.jpg	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a pathogenic bacterial species in the genus Mycobacterium and the causative agent of most cases of tuberculosis.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/mtb_h37rv_v2/session.php	
animal	H. sapiens (hg19)	hsapiens.png	Humans, known taxonomically as Homo sapiens, are the only living species in the Homo genus of bipedal primates in Hominidae, the great ape family. Anatomically modern-appearing humans originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago, reaching full behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/hg19/session.php

microbial	M. smegmatis	smeg.jpg	Mycobacterium smegmatis is 3.0 to 5.0 µm long with a bacillus shape, an acid-fast bacterial species in the phylum Actinobacteria. M. smegmatis is generally considered a non-pathogenic microorganism; however, in some very rare cases, it may cause disease, likely requiring an immunocompromised animal. M. smegmatis is useful for the research analysis of other Mycobacteria species in laboratory experiments.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/msmeg_mc2_155/session.php
animal	M. musculus (mm9)	mouse.jpg	A mouse (plural: mice) is a small mammal belonging to the order of rodents. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are also common. This rodent is eaten by large birds such as hawks and eagles. They are known to invade homes for food and occasionally shelter.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/mm9/session.php

animal	R. norvegicus(rn4)	rat.jpg	Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. "True rats" are members of the genus Rattus, the most important of which to humans are the black rat, Rattus rattus, and the brown rat, Rattus norvegicus. Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/rn4/session.php
