demo	B. anthracis	b_anthracis.jpg	This tutorial data set contains a bacterial genome <b>sequence</b> with <b>annotations for genes, rRNA and tRNA</b>.  Two sequencing data sets are included as well: (i) an <b>RNA-seq experiment</b> and (ii) a <b>whole genome sequencing</b> experiment. Furthermore, there are two optional <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/b_anthracis/download/anthracis.maf.gz"><b>multiple alignments</b></a> available for this genome.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/b_anthracis/session.php
demo	C. elegans	c_elegans.jpg	This tutorial data set includes the reference <b>sequence</b> for <i>C. elegans</i>, as well as its <b>gene annotion</b>. We also included an <b>RNA-seq</b> data set, both as individual reads and as a pileup track.	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/c_elegans/session.php
demo	D. melanogaster	d_melanogaster.jpg	This tutorial data set includes the reference <b>sequence</b> for D. melanogaster, as well as <b>gene annotation</b>. A <b>multiple alignment</b> of twelve Drosophila species is included as a MAF file. Furthermore, transcriptome data in the form of <b>paired-end RNA-seq</b> is loaded. 	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/demo/d_melanogaster/session.php
