plant	Arabidopsis lyrata	aly.jpg	<em>Arabidopsis lyrata</em> is, together with Arabidopsis thaliana, a member of the Arabidopsis genus. As the thaliana species is widely used as model organism within the green plants lineage, the sequencing of the lyrata species is expected to reveal important comparative genomic data with respect to genomic content, lifestyle differences, etc. The lyrate genome has approximately the same number of genes as the thaliana genome (33000 genes), but the genome itself is 50% larger, while the species only diverged approximately 5 million years ago. <br/><br/><p><strong>Further reading: </strong></p> <br/><p> Publication pending. </p> 	http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/downloads/genomeview/genomes/plazasessions/aly/JGI 1.0/session.php
plant	Arabidopsis thaliana	ath.jpg	<em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> , or the mouse-ear cress, is to plant sciences, what mouse is to animal biology.

plant	Micromonas sp. RCC299	mrcc299.jpg	Micromonas is a eukaryotic, photosynthetic microorganism found throughout marine ecosystems - from polar waters to the tropics. It is classified as a member of the picophytoplankton because of its small size (< 2 ï¿½m in diameter). Currently, picophytoplankton are known to be important to primary production, but the individual contributions of each of the different groups, or species (with Micromonas being one of those), aren't well known. To date, Micromonas strains have been described as belonging to a single species. Micromonas pusilla was reported as early as 1951 to be highly abundant in marine systems (Knight-Jones & Walne 1951). However, it is likely that the designation Micromonas pusilla harbors several different (cryptic) species (Slapeta et al. 2006, Worden 2006). Genome sequences from different strains of this organism will help to answer such questions.  	http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/downloads/genomeview/genomes/plazasessions/mrcc299/JGI 3.0/session.php

plant	Oryza sativa ssp. japonica	osa.jpg	The rice genome was sequenced because of it &#8217;s major importance in the world food industry and it &#8217;s relatively small genome size. Since the first sequenced plant genome (<em>Arabidopsis thalia</em>) was a dicotylous plant it made sense to sequence a monocot next to have a broad taxonomix sampling. Unlike many of the recently sequenced genomes the sequencing has been done using a BAC-by-BAC approach a very costly a labour intensive procedure. But this yields a very high quality genome that can be assembled into chromosomes.  <br /><br /><p><strong>Further reading: </strong></p> <br /><p> In-depth view of structure, activity, and evolution of rice chromosome 10. <em>Science</em> <strong>300</strong>, 1566-9 (2003).

plant	Ostreococcus tauri	ota.jpg	Ostreococcus belongs to the Prasinophyceae, an early-diverging class within the green plant lineage, and is reported as a globally abundant, single-celled alga thriving in the upper (illuminated) water column of the oceans. The most striking feature of O. tauri and related species is their minimal cellular organization: a naked, nearly 1-micron cell, lacking flagella, with a single chloroplast and mitochondrion.  Three different ecotypes or potential species have been defined, based on their adaptation to light intensity. One (O. lucimarinus) is adapted to high light intensities and corresponds to surface-isolated strains. The second (RCC141) has been defined as low-light and includes strains from deeper in the water column. The third (O.tauri) corresponds to strains isolated from a coastal lagoon and can be considered light-polyvalent. Comparative analysis of Ostreococcus sp will help to understand niche differentiation in unicellular eukaryotes and evolution of genome size in eukaryotes. 	http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/downloads/genomeview/genomes/plazasessions/ota/JGI 2.0/session.php

plant	Populus trichocarpa	ptr.jpg	The black cottonwood is a tree common to western parts of North America. Although closely related species are common in other parts of the world.

Techniques for high-throughput transformation are available, that in combination with the genome sequence become valuable tools to create transgenic plants. <br /> As the cottonwood can grow on marginal lands, where it is commonly used as windbreaks, it can also be used as a crop for second generation bio-fuels.   <br /><br /><p><strong>Further reading: </strong></p> <br /><p> Tuskan, G.A. et al.

plant	Sorghum bicolor	sbi.jpg	Cereals play a major role in the world&#8217;s food industry. Even though Sorghum itself is an important food crop, it&#8217;s especially interesting since it&#8217;s very closely related to maize and sugarcane. But as these two species had additional whole genome duplications their genomes are four times larger and are very hard to sequence due to the redundancy in the genome. <br /> Unlike previously sequenced plants Sorghum also has &#8220;C4&#8221; photosynthesis; this is an adaptation of the standard &#8220;C3&#8221;; photosynthesis, that assimilates carbon better at high temperatures. <br /><br /><p><strong>Further reading: </strong></p> <br /><p> Paterson, A.H. et al.

plant	Selaginella moellendorffii	smo.jpg	<em>Selaginella moellendorffii</em> is a lycophyte that is an important  model organism, especially in comparative genomics.  S. moellendorffii is a member of an ancient vascular plant lineage that  first appear in the fossil record some 400 million years ago.  They would later form a dominant part of the world's flora during the  Carboniferous era. These lycopsids lack true leaves  (having microphylls instead) and roots and thus represent an important  node on the plant evolutionary tree. As the oldest extant division of the  vascular plants, they are essential to understanding the evolution of plants  as a whole. <br/> The nuclear genome size is approximately 100 mega base pairs,  the smallest genome size found for any plant species.  The genome has been sequenced and assembled by the  DOE Joint Genome Institute. Community annotation of the genes and other  elements of this genome began in September 2007. See the website, below, for more information on how to contribute to this effort. <br/><br/> <em> The Joint Genome Institute provides these data in good faith,  but makes no warranty, expressed or implied, nor assumes any legal liability  or responsibility for any purpose for which the data are used.

plant	Volvox carteri	vca.jpg	Volvox is one of the best-known chlorophytes and is the most developed in a series of genera that form spherical colonies. Each Volvox is composed of numerous flagellate cells similar to Chlamydomonas, on the order of 10003000 in total, interconnected and arranged in a glycoprotein-filled sphere (coenobium). The cells swim in a coordinated fashion, with a distinct anterior and posterior  or since Volvox resembles a little planet, a 'north' pole and a 'south' pole. The cells have eyespots, more developed near the anterior, which enable the colony to swim towards light.  An asexual colony includes both somatic, or vegetative, cells, which do not reproduce, and gonidia near the posterior, which produces new colonies through repeated division. These daughter colonies are initially held within the parent and have their flagella directed inwards. Later, the parent disintegrates and the daughters invert. In sexual reproduction two types of gametes are produced. Volvox species can be monoecious or dioecious. Male colonies release numerous microgametes, or sperm, while in female colonies single cells enlarge to become oogametes, or eggs. 	http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/downloads/genomeview/genomes/plazasessions/vca/JGI 1.0/session.php
