microbial	M. smegmatis	smeg.jpg	"Mycobacterium smegmatis is 3.0 to 5.0 µm long with a bacillus shape, an acid-fast bacterial species in the phylum Actinobacteria. M. smegmatis is generally considered a non-pathogenic microorganism; however, in some very rare cases, it may cause disease, likely requiring an immunocompromised animal. M. smegmatis is useful for the research analysis of other Mycobacteria species in laboratory experiments."	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/msmeg_mc2_155/session.php

insect	D. melanogaster(dm3)	d_melanogaster.jpg	"Drosophila melanogaster is a species of Diptera, or the order of flies, in the family Drosophilidae. The species is commonly known as the common fruit fly or vinegar fly. Starting from Charles W. Woodworth, this species is one of the most commonly used model organisms in biology, including studies in genetics, physiology, microbial pathogenesis and life history evolution because they are easy to take care of, breed quickly, and lay many eggs."	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/dm3/session.php
insect	D. simulans (droSim1)	d_melanogaster.jpg	Drosophila simulans is a species of fly closely related to D. melanogaster and which belongs to the same melanogaster species subgroup.

'True rats' are members of the genus Rattus, the most important of which to humans are the black rat, Rattus rattus, and the brown rat, Rattus norvegicus. Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats."	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/rn4/session.php
fungi	N. crassa (NC10)	ncrassa.png	"Neurospora crassa is a type of red bread mold of the phylum Ascomycota. The genus name, meaning 'nerve spore' refers to the characteristic striations on the spores. N. crassa is used as a model organism because it is easy to grow and has a haploid life cycle that makes genetic analysis simple since recessive traits will show up in the offspring. Analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of meiosis in Neurospora ascospores. Its entire genome of seven chromosomes has been sequenced.<br><a href='http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/neurospora/'>http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/neurospora/</a>."	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/nc10/session.php
fungi	S. cerevisiae (S288C)	saccer.png	"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast. It is perhaps the most useful yeast, having been instrumental to baking and brewing since ancient times. It is believed that it was originally isolated from the skin of grapes (one can see the yeast as a component of the thin white film on the skins of some dark-colored fruits such as plums; it exists among the waxes of the cuticle). It is one of the most intensively studied eukaryotic model organisms in molecular and cell biology, much like Escherichia coli as the model bacterium. It is the microorganism behind the most common type of fermentation. S. cerevisiae cells are round to ovoid, 5–10 micrometres in diameter. It reproduces by a division process known as budding."	http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/genomeview/genomes/sacCer20111201/session.php
